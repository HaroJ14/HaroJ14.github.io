### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was one of my favroite labs, because it focused on coding for the Blackjack Score game. The goal of this game is to draw the highest score, and players take turns playing. The catch is that you cannot exceed the number 21 or you lose, which is referred to as a "bust". It was such an amazing feeling when my lab partner and I were able to get our game to function. We were able to code what our professor wanted us to, and we appreciated that feeling of being challenged by the lab.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 , part 2 this lab, there was a guessing game from 1 to 100, and the player may try again if they pressed the play button and indicated that they wanted to play again; otherwise, if they selected the correct answer, a message would appear to let them know. In this lab, we had to find a way to control an infinite loop. In this lab, we had to figure out how to manage an endless loop. We accomplished this by use a do-while loop.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 I enjoyed how we were able to write something to calculate the amount of people in each county in. To compute the county's population, we had to download a file, which was new to us and challenging. To arrange the population data by country, we utilized a vector. We learned how to organize a set of 2D vectors while learning how to create a table during this time.
